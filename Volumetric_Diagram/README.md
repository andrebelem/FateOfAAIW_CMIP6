### This folder shows how to create the files for the volumetric T–S diagram. First, you need to download the data, then create the dataframes using the notebook "Creation_Dataframes_50S_20S.ipynb". The same code was used for the other region in the article.

The 3D volumetric T–S diagram was generated in Surfer 3D. If you have any questions about the procedure, feel free to email the authors. In short, the output file — a dataframe — was exported to Surfer and gridded in the software.
